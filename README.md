# Farzad Ferdous â€” Interactive AI Portfolio ðŸ¤–

Why scroll through endless static pages when you can have a **portfolio that talks back**?  
This is not just a showcase â€” itâ€™s an **AI-powered conversation** about what I build, how I think, and the impact Iâ€™ve made.

## Who This Is For

- **Recruiters & Hiring Managers:** Quickly get a sense of my stack, projects, and results.  
- **Fellow Developers:** Dive into code patterns, architectures, and technical insights.  
- **Friends & Curious Minds:** See the side projects, experiments, and hackathon wins Iâ€™m proud of.  

Ask a question â€” my AI avatar (me, Farzad) responds instantly, making the experience personal and dynamic.
