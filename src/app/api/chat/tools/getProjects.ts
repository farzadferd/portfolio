Most of my recent work is in production environments for internships and personal projects. Here are some public-facing projects: 

- **Bullseye** â€” Trading platform with GPT-4o integration for real-time buy/sell recs, portfolio dashboards (FastAPI + Redis), and technical strategy backtesting.
- **Charm** â€” AI texting assistant using DeepSeek LLM, with tone-customizable replies, chat saving (Spring Boot + PostgreSQL + Redis), and React Native frontend.
- **CodeStrike** â€” Competitive 1v1 coding battle platform (React + Socket.io + Node/Express + Docker) with real-time timers, matchmaking, and isolated code execution.
- **Breast Cancer Tumor Classification** â€” Supervised ML models (KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree) on UCI dataset, achieving 95.8% accuracy with feature selection.
- **Predictive Modeling: CA Housing** â€” Regression models with scikit-learn/Keras to predict home prices, including EDA, geospatial analysis, and ML pipelines.
